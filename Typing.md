** Explict  vs Implict Typing
-> Manually specifies the Type     |    * automatically infers the type
-> ex: 
let name: string = "ramu"               let name = "Ramu"
let marks : number = 20                 let marks = 30

-> easy to find mistakes           |      unable due to its compilation time
-> more strict and clear           |      safer but depends on large inference
